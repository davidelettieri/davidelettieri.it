After thinking about it for some time I decided to add a comment system to the blog. What I hope is that I will get valuable feedback from readers, which will help me improve the content, my understanding of the topics I write about, and the overall quality of the blog.

### How It Was Built

I decided all of this while on a beach, in Italy and I didn't have access to a coding environment. So I decided to treat myself with a copilot pro license and try to get it implemented by the copilot agent.

Somehow it worked out, I realized quickly that I didn't give enough information to complete the task, but with some back-and-forth, we got there in the end.
