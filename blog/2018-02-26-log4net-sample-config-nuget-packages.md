## Sample log4net config nuget packages
Everytime I install the log4net nuget package I have to lookup, on the internet or on my other project, how to modify the app.config or the web.config in order to make log4net work.

I decided to create a few nuget packages with sample configs and a small readme in order to easily configure log4net. It took some trial & error but I managed to create a couple of them. The source for the packages in at [log4net-config](https://github.com/davidelettieri/log4net-config) repository.

In order to build the package just run "nuget pack" in the folder with the *.nuspec file.

Enjoy!
